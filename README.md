# Zeitbook

[ ![Codeship Status for zeitspace/zeitbook-frontend](https://app.codeship.com/projects/5656a700-a2f9-0135-15e6-76731562ca18/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/254818)

The starter application for Zeitspace's workshop on Progressive Web Apps.

Check out the [non-PWA](https://zeitbook-nonpwa.herokuapp.com) and [PWA](https://zeitbook-pwa.herokuapp.com) versions.

## Arriving late?

Complete the instructions under [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) and [Setup](#setup), with one difference. If you're cloning this repository using Git, check out either the `step-1`, `step-2`, `step-3`, or `step-4` branch based on the current step. If you're downloading this repository as a ZIP file, use one of the following links:

- [Step 1](https://github.com/zeitspace/zeitbook-frontend/archive/step-1.zip)
- [Step 2](https://github.com/zeitspace/zeitbook-frontend/archive/step-2.zip)
- [Step 3](https://github.com/zeitspace/zeitbook-frontend/archive/step-3.zip)
- [Step 4](https://github.com/zeitspace/zeitbook-frontend/archive/step-4.zip)

Next, go to [the instructions for the current step](#steps).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

1. A recent version of Google Chrome.
1. A text editor or an IDE. If you donâ€™t have one installed, we recommend [Atom](https://atom.io).
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com). After installing Git, clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/zeitspace/zeitbook-frontend.git`. If you don't want to install Git, you can [download the starter application as a ZIP file](https://github.com/zeitspace/zeitbook-frontend/archive/master.zip).
1. [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Setup

1. In your command line, navigate to the directory containing the source code for this starter application.
1. Change the contents of `src/username.js`, replacing `[NAME]` with a username of your choice. This is the name that will appear on your posts and comments on Zeitbook.
1. Create a copy of `assets/scripts/environment.example.js` at `assets/scripts/environment.js`. This file contains the URL and Firebase credentials for the shared Zeitbook API server (https://zeitbook.herokuapp.com). (At some point, we may shut down this server. You'll still be able to run Zeitbook using a local instance of the API server and your own Firebase project. If you want to do this, make sure to follow [the instructions for setting up the backend server](https://github.com/zeitbook/zeitbook-backend#readme), then update `assets/scripts/environment.js` with your own API server URL and Firebase credentials).
1. Run `npm install`, then `npm start`.
1. Open [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in Google Chrome.

## Steps

### Step 1: [Web app manifest](./steps/01-web-app-manifest.md)

You'll add a manifest file that tells browsers how to display your application and lets them prompt your users to install it to their homescreens.

### Step 2: [Service worker](./steps/02-service-worker.md)

A service worker is a script that browsers run in the background and that can communicate with your application. You'll create a service worker that caches API requests and the application's own resources.

### Step 3: [Push notifications](./steps/03-push-notifications.md)

Using the service worker you created in Step 2, you'll set up your application to display push notifications when someone replies to your posts or comments.

### Step 4: [Background Sync](./steps/04-background-sync.md)

You'll use the Background Sync API to let users create posts and comments while offline.

## Other concepts

Here are two PWA-related concepts that we don't have time to cover during the workshop:

### App Shell

The App Shell is a technique for building the layout of a PWA. It involves aggressively caching the minimal HTML, CSS and JS required to render the application's UI, so that it renders near-instantly on repeat visits. After rendering the app shell, the browser loads the application's dynamic content using JavaScript. The goal of this technique is to allow the user to interact with the application more quickly.

### RAIL performance model

RAIL is a performance model based on four key ideas:

- Respond to users immediately; acknowledge user input in under 100ms
- When animating or scrolling, produce a frame in under 10ms
- Maximize main thread idle time
- Keep users engaged; deliver interactive content in under 1000ms

RAIL is a user-centric performance model. It suggests that you focus on the user's experience while using your application, rather than on trying to shave milliseconds off of page load times on a specific device.
